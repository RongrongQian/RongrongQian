## Hi there 👋

I am a dedicated Master’s student in Statistics (GPA 4.0/4.0) and a Graduate Assistant at Miami University, specializing in leveraging advanced statistical methods to solve real-world problems.

My specific research interest lies in **Statistical Genomics and Bioinformatics**, with a core focus on **GWAS Imputation** using summary data. I have developed robust **R workflows** within **Linux HPC environments** to process, clean, and perform quality control on million-row genomic datasets, demonstrating strong technical proficiency in big data handling.

I possess a comprehensive skill set in data analysis and application development, including:
* **Statistical Software:** R, Python, SAS (Certified Specialist), Power BI, SQL.
* **Applied Projects:** Developed statistical metrics and visualizations to assist a client in improving their diving judge assessment application; led teams to create interactive data narratives (e.g., US Chronic Health Mortality Indicators in R Shiny); and designed dynamic visualization tools (e.g., Tornado Visualization using SAS Macro).
  
As a Volunteer Statistical Consultant, I excel at communicating complex statistical concepts to non-technical clients, translating business questions into rigorous analytical strategies.

My ultimate goal is to apply my expertise in statistical rigor and scientific computing to positively contribute to human health and wellness, particularly at the intersection of scientific research and health-related businesses.
